# ARC_reactivation_model
Mathematical model of dynamic antigen expression in HIV reservoir clones.

This repository contains code for simulations of our model of transient antigen expression and for fitting to simulated and real data. All necessary code is included in the jupyter notebook **ARC_reactivation_model.ipynb**. This file can be opened and run in Google Colab to recreate our analaysis of ARC data. Access the active version on Colab through this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zJJaVwacgs4qot6J3AYt5iPx9uzr3ved?usp=sharingc).

1. System requirements
- any system that can run a jupyter notebook
3. Installation guide
- download the jupyter notebook and run it on Google Colab
- less than 5 minutes to install
4. Demo
 - There is a code block included in jupyter notebook that generates simulated data and shows model fitting results
6. Instructions for use
 - To fit this model to your own data, replace the data entered in the "experimental data" code chunks with your own
